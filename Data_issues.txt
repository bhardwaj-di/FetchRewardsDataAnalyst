As per my observation I found below points had data issues in the data provided.
1. There were in total approximate 2500 null values in 1119 records in just "receipt.json" file.
2. There are lots of redundant data in the "user.json" file.
3. In Receipts and User Data 'date' columns are in UNIX timestamp format, which needs to be converted into standard DateTime format.
4. Creating a rewardreceiptitemlist does not contribute much to insights as there is excess missing data.
5. In "brand.json" the barcode is same for different brand.
6. In "brand.json" (brandCode, topBrand, category) columns records are missing which is essential part for understanding the data.
